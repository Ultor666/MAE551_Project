# MAE551_Project
In this comprehensive machine learning project, our primary objective is to tackle the critical issue 
of predictive maintenance in industrial settings. The project focuses on the development and 
evaluation of predictive maintenance algorithms utilizing a meticulously designed synthetic 
dataset, closely mirroring real-world scenarios. With a dataset comprising 10,000 data points and 
14 crucial features, encompassing variables such as air and process temperatures, rotational speed, 
torque, and tool wear, our aim is to establish a robust super learning algorithm. This algorithm 
integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting 
methods as base learners. The overarching goal is to create a model capable of forecasting machine 
failures or categorizing specific failure types, thereby contributing significantly to the 
enhancement of machinery reliability and operational efficiency.
Furthermore, we explore an alternative approach by developing a distinct Long Short-Term 
Memory-Generative Adversarial Network (LSTM-GAN) method. This method is then 
systematically compared with the super learning algorithm on various performance parameters, 
providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective strengths and weaknesses. The insights 
gained from this comparative evaluation aim to guide future developments in predictive 
maintenance strategies, offering a valuable contribution to the field of industrial machinery 
reliability and performance optimization.
